h1. CodeFellow

*Scala development tool for Vim and Sbt*

h2. Features

The following features are already implemented in Vim:

* Member completion 
* Scope completion 
* Get type information for expressions
* Support for multi-module builds (each module will have it's own classpath)

Planned:

* Too many :-)

h2. Installation

1. Build CodeFellow

bc. git clone git://github.com/romanroe/codefellow.git
cd codefellow
sbt update publish-local

2. Install the Vim plugin

bc. cp <<codefellow_dir>>/vim/plugin/codefellow.vim ~/.vim/plugin/

3. Add the CodeFellow plugin to your project (project/plugins/Plugins.scala)

bc. import sbt._
class Plugins(info: ProjectInfo) extends PluginDefinition(info) {
  val a = "de.tuxed" % "codefellow-plugin" % "0.1"
}

4. Mixin the CodeFellow trait to your project definition

bc. class YourProject(info: ProjectInfo)
extends ParentProject(info)
with de.tuxed.codefellow.plugin.CodeFellowPlugin { 
  ...
}

5. Run the plugin:

bc. sbt codefellow

6. Start the CodeFellow deamon from your project root directory (this step will get merged with the above one in the future)

bc. java -cp <codefellow_dir>>/project/boot/scala-2.8.0.RC5/lib/scala-library.jar:\
         <codefellow_dir>>/project/boot/scala-2.8.0.RC5/lib/scala-compiler.jar:\
         <codefellow_dir>>/codefellow-core/target/scala_2.8.0.RC5/classes \
         de.tuxed.codefellow.Launch

7. Start Vim and open a Scala file that belongs to your project

h2. Usage

*Note:* The first invocation of a CodeFellow feature might take a couple of seconds since the compiler daemon for each module in your build will be started on demand.

The following key bindings are available:

|Ctrl+s Ctrl+m | Activate member completion function and trigger omni completion |
|Ctrl+s Ctrl+s | Activate scope completion function and trigger omni completion |
|Ctrl+s Ctrl+t | Print type information of expression under cursor |

Please not that the completion function will trigger a buffer save.

h2. Acknowledgement

* Almost all functionality for the code completion is already implemented in the Scala compiler. CodeFellow would not be possible without the work of the Scala compiler team!
* I learned most about the Scala compiler by looking at and using the source code from "aemoncannon's":http://github.com/aemoncannon emacs mode "ensime":http://github.com/aemoncannon/ensime. Thank you!
