h2. Acknowledgement

* Almost all functionality for the code completion is already implemented in the Scala compiler. CodeFellow would not be possible without the work of the Scala compiler team!
* I learned most about the Scala compiler by looking at and using the source code from "aemoncannon's":http://github.com/aemoncannon emacs mode "ensime":http://github.com/aemoncannon/ensime. Thank you!
